# quickstart-cloud9-ide
## AWS Cloud9 Cloud-Based IDE

This Quick Start deploys Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud9 integrated development environment (IDE) in the AWS Cloud in about 30 minutes.

You can use AWS Cloud9 to run and debug code from a browser while seamlessly sharing your development environment with your team. The Quick Start includes an AWS Lambda function custom resource that resizes the default Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume size for your Cloud9 instance with the size that you choose. AWS Cloud9 isnâ€™t currently supported in all AWS Regions. For a current list of supported regions, see [AWS Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cloud9_region) in the AWS documentation.

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying AWS Cloud9 into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) on AWS
- Deploying AWS Cloud9 into an existing VPC on AWS
